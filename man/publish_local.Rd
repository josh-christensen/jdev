\usage{
publish_local(repository_path, package_path = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{repository_path}{Folder in which to create the repository or update an
existing one.}

\item{package_path}{Path to the parent directory of the package to be
published.}
}
\description{
Generate or update a directory structure that can be read by
\code{utils::install.packages}.
}
\details{
The function currently only behaves as intended on the Windows operating
system. Create or update a directory structure that is recognized by
\code{utils::install.packages} as a package repository. The function publishes the
referenced package both as a source tarball and as a binary package for the
Windows operating system. As a result, installation of the package will fail
if attempted from a different operating system with no available toolchain
unless a separate binary is created and added.
